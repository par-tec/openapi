  This schema describes RFC7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs.
  The specification is intentionally flexible, and allows to adapt
  the schema adding further properties, or not enforcing any of the properties
  below.

  To make this schema safe by default, additionalProperties are forbidden though.
  In case you need them, you can either re-define Problem or extend it
  using `allOf`.
properties:
  detail:
    description: |
      A human readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the
      problem. You MUST NOT expose internal informations, personal
      data or implementation details through this field.

    example: Request took too long to complete.
    maxLength: 4096
    pattern: ^.{0,1024}$
    type: string
  instance:

    type: string
  status:
